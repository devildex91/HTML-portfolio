    <p>My Journey into Web Development started in 2024 due to unforseen personel 
        circumstances i have had to look to change jobs having previously trained
         as a Joiner and Cabinet maker but having to give up that career to look 
         after my family i looked elsewhere for a job that could be done remotly 
        and having previously failed to get myself into coding at college i thought 
        I would have a go at training myself and found a few different courses online
    to help me reach my goal of supporting my family through my new found love of coding 
    developing different projects of which you can browse through on this website. </p>
